OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is just blueprint how 2 system should be communicating
it is a layered architecture about how data will travell from place to place
it consists of 7 layers
it is theoritical model or refference model not practical model.
(tcp/ip model is practical model,it also communicating between two devices,it has 4 layers(Application,transport,network,network access layer))
(every layer is independent of each other in both model)
(osi trick- Aj fir se test nhi dena pdega)
(tcp/ip model is less detailed and osi model is detailed)
