imp Q.1) how does the internet works or how to data work flow or how two computer sharing data?
Ans-> internet is a group of connected devices.
(dns returns the ip adress)(ip changed in different networks)
1. Application Layer
	DNS resolution
2. Transport Layer
	Adds the port in the header
	Establishes the connection
3. Network Layer
	Add the create header by adding IPs
	It will check whether the source and dest IPs are in the same network or not. It wil check using the routing table (IP & SM = NID)
	ARP protocol to find out the MAC of the gateway router.
