datagram->speed is high,but packate lost is happend,data go from one location to another with
any path not dependend on one path.
ps(packet switching)-> packate trasffer krne ko packet switching kehte hai.method of data transmission whereby the data is divided in packets
Packet switched networks are connectionless networks.
two types of packate swiching technique->
1)Virtual Circuit Packet Switching:-> in this the packet go from one device to another with only one decided path.
2)Datagram Packet Switching:-> in this the packate go from one device to another with different paths.

cs(circuit switching)->Circuit switched networks are connection-oriented networks. Here, a dedicated route is established between the source and the
 destination and the entire message is transferred through it.
